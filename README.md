  <p ><b>Discord - Account Control</b></p>
</div>

<h1>How does it work ?</h1>
<p><strong>The script is completely based on the "requests" module of python. ( Documentation : https://pypi.org/project/requests/ )</strong><p>
<p>It also uses the Discord HTTP API to communicate with and do the actions possible in the program</p>

I only use ```GET``` ```POST``` and ```DELETE```to make it as simple as possible

<h1>What are the possibilities of the program ?</h1>

```I want to clarify that I designed this program entirely for fun and that it was not really useful.```
<ol>
<li><b>Send Messages</li>
<li><b>Modify Messages</b></li>
<li><b>Delete Messages</b></li>
<li><b>Add Reactions</b></li>
<li><b>Infinite Typing</b></li>
</ol>

<p>- That's all ???</p>
<p>- Yes.</p>
<p>- It's empty</p>
<p>- Maybe if I find other things to add, I'll do an update</p>
